## Draco REST API

As Draco was built using the NiFi's engine, it has the same REST API command control than NiFi.

The Rest Api provides programmatic access to command and control a NiFi instance in real time. Start and stop processors, monitor queues, query provenance data, and more. Each endpoint below includes a description, definitions of the expected input and output, potential response codes, and the authorizations required to invoke each service.
 
You can find all the available options following this link [NIFI REST API](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/rest-api/index.html)
