Draco is a is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. Internally, Draco is based
on [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/docs.html), NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based
programming. It supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation
logic. It was built to automate the flow of data between systems. While the term 'dataflow' is used in a variety of
contexts, we use it here to mean the automated and managed flow of information between systems.
